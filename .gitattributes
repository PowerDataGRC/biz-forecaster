# Set the default behavior for all text files.
# Git will normalize line endings to LF on commit and convert to CRLF on checkout on Windows.
* text=auto

# Explicitly force LF line endings for shell scripts, as they require it to run correctly
# in Unix-like environments (like Git Bash, WSL, or CI/CD runners).
*.sh text eol=lf
*.bash text eol=lf

# For any other file types that must have a specific line ending, add them here.
