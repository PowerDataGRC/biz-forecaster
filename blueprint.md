# BizForecaster Blueprint

## Overview

BizForecaster is a powerful and intuitive platform designed to help businesses forecast future trends, analyze data, and make informed decisions. The application provides a suite of tools for data visualization, trend analysis, and predictive modeling, all presented in a user-friendly and accessible interface.

## Data Model

The application follows a hierarchical data model:

*   **Tenant:** The top-level entity, representing a company or organization.
    *   Each tenant is isolated, meaning a tenant's data is not accessible to other tenants.
    *   Tenant registration requires a secure token.
*   **Location:** Each tenant can have multiple locations or branches.
*   **User:** Each location can have up to 2000 users.
    *   Users are associated with a specific tenant and location.
    *   User registration requires a secure token.
*   **Client:** Each user can have multiple clients.
*   **Activity:** Each client can engage in multiple activities. An activity includes operational data such as:
    *   A list of items that need to be completed to start a business.
    *   A list of capital expenses.
    *   A list of operational expenses.
    *   A list of products and prices.
    *   Cost of goods or services sold.
    *   Seasonality factors.
    *   Sales projections.
    *   Balance sheet and other financial data.
*   **BusinessPlan:** Each client can have multiple business plans. A business plan includes strategic information such as:
    *   Mission statement.
    *   Marketing strategy.
    *   Other business strategies.
    *   This entity is kept separate from `Activity` to distinguish between strategic planning and operational activities.
